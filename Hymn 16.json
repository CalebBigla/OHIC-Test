Highest angels in glory;<br>Strength and honor give to His holy Name!<br>Like a shepherd, Jesus will guard His Children,<br>In His arms He carries them all day long;<br>O ye saints that dwell on the mountain of His zion,<br>Praise Him! praise Him! <br>Ever in joyful song!<br><br>2.  Praise Him! praise Him!<br><br>Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,<br>For our sins He suffered and bled and died;<br>He, our Rock, our Hope of eternal salvation,<br>Hail Him! hail Him! Jesus, the Crucified;<br>Loving Savior, meekly enduring sorrow,<br>Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow;<br>Once for us rejected, despised, and forsaken,<br>Prince of Glory, ever triumphant now.<br><br>3.  Praise Him! praise Him! <br>Jesus, our blessed Redeemer,<br>Heav'nly portals, loud with hosannas ring!<br>Jesus, Savior, reigneth for ever and ever;<br>Crown Him! crown Him! Prophet and Priest and King!<br>Death is vanquished! Tell it with joy, ye faithful,<br>Where is now thy victory, boasting grave?<br>Jesus lives! No longer thy portals are cheerless;<br>Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.",
