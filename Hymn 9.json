    "lyrics": "1.	Immortal, invisible, God only wise,<br>In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,<br>Most blessed, most glorious,<br>the Ancient of Days,<br>Almighty, victorious,<br>Thy great name we praise.<br><br>2.	Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,<br>Nor wanting, nor wasting,<br>Thou rulest in might;<br>Thy justice like mountains<br>high soaring above<br>	Thy clouds which are fountains<br>of goodness and love.<br><br>3.	To all life Thou givest,<br>to both great and small;<br>In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;<br>We blossom and flourish <br>as leaves on the tree,<br>And wither and perish,<br>but nought changeth Thee.<br><br>4.	Great Father of Glory,<br>pure Father of Light<br>Thine angels adore Thee, <br>all veiling their sight;<br>All laud we would render, O help us to see:<br>â€™Tis only the splendour of light hideth Thee.",
