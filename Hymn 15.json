Pass me not, O gentle savior<br>Hear my humble cry<br>While on others Thou art calling<br>Do not pass me by.<br><br>Saviour, Saviour<br>Hear my humble cry<br>While on others Thou art calling<br>Do not pass me by.<br><br>2. 	Let me at thy throne of mercy<br>Find a sweet relief;<br>Kneeling there in deep contrition<br>Help my unbelief.<br><br>3.	Trusting only in the Thy merit<br>would i seek thy face<br>Heal my wounded, broken spirit,<br>save me by thy grace.<br><br>4.	Thou, the spring of all my comfort<br>More than life to me<br>Whom have I on earth beside Thee<br>Whom in Heav'n but Thee?",
