I need Thee ev'ry hour,<br>Most gracious Lord;<br>No tender voice  like Thine<br>Can peace afford.<br><br>Chorus:<br><br>  I need Thee, O I need Thee,<br>Ev'ry hour I need Thee<br>O bless me now, my Saviour<br>I come to Thee!<br><br>2.	I need Thee every hour<br>Stay Thou nearby<br>Temptations lose their power<br>When Thou art nigh.<br><br>3.	I need Thee every hour,<br>In joy or pain;<br>Come quickly and abide<br>Or life is vain.<br><br>4.	I need Thee every hour<br>Teach me Thy will,<br>And Thy rich promises<br>In me fulfill.<br><br>5.	I need Thee every hour<br>Most Holy One;<br>Oh, make me thine indeed,<br>Thou blessed Son!",
