Yes, Jesus loves me!<br>Yes, Jesus loves me! The Bible tells me so.<br><br>2.	Jesus loves me! He who died,<br>Heavenâ€™s gate to open wide;<br>He will wash away my sin,<br>Let His little child come in.<br><br>3.	Jesus loves me, loves me still<br>Tho' I'm very weak and ill<br>From His shinning throne on high<br>He will watch me where I lie.<br><br>4.	Jesus Loves Me! He Will Stay<br>Close Beside Me All The Way;<br>If I love Him when I die.<br>He will take me home on high.",
