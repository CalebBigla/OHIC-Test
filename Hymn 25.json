Your many sins are all forgiven,<br>oh! hear the voice of Jesus;<br>go on your way in peace to heaven,<br>and wear a crown with Jesus. [Refrain]<br><br>3. 	All glory to the risen Lamb!<br>I now believe in Jesus;<br>I love the blessed Savior's name,<br>I love the name of Jesus. [Refrain]<br><br>4. 	His name dispels my guilt and fear,<br>no other name but Jesus;<br>oh! how my soul delights to hear<br>the charming name of Jesus. [Refrain]",
