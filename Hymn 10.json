  "lyrics": "1.	In Christ alone my hope is found<br>He is my light, my strength, my song<br>This Cornerstone, this solid ground<br>Firm through the fiercest drought and storm<br>What heights of love, what depths of peace<br>When fears are stilled, when strivings cease<br>My Comforter, my All in All<br>Here in the love of Christ I stand<br><br>2.	In Christ alone, who took on flesh<br>Fullness of God in helpless Babe<br>This gift of love and righteousness<br>Scorned by the ones He came to save<br>'Til on that cross as Jesus died<br>The wrath of God was satisfied<br>For every sin on Him was laid<br>Here in the death of Christ I live, I live<br><br>3.	There in the ground His body lay<br>Light of the world by darkness slain<br>Then bursting forth in glorious Day<br>Up from the grave He rose again<br>And as He stands in victory<br>Sin's curse has lost its grip on me<br>For I am His and He is mine<br>Bought with the precious blood of Christ<br><br>4.	No guilt in life, no fear in death<br>This is the power of Christ in me<br>From a life's first cry to final breath<br>Jesus commands my destiny<br>No power of hell, no scheme of man<br>Could ever pluck me from His hand<br>'Til He returns or calls me home<br>Here in the power of Christ I stand",
