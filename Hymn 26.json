There shall be showers of blessing:<br>This is the promise of love;<br>There shall be seasons refreshing,<br>Sent from the Savior above.<br><br>Refrain:	<br><br>Showers of blessing,<br>Showers of blessing we need:<br>Mercy-drops round us are falling,<br>But for the showers we plead.<br><br>2. 	There shall be showers of blessing,<br>Precious reviving again;<br>Over the hills and the valleys,<br>Sound of abundance of rain. [Refrain]<br><br>3. 	There shall be showers of blessing:<br>Send them upon us, O Lord;<br>Grant to us now a refreshing,<br>Come and now honor Thy Word. [Refrain]<br><br>4. 	There shall be showers of blessing:<br>Oh, that today they might fall,<br>Now as to God we're confessing,<br>Now as on Jesus we call! [Refrain]",
