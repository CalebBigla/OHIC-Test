    "lyrics": "1. 	Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br>that calls me from a world of care,<br>and bids me at my Father's throne<br>make all my wants and wishes known.<br>In seasons of distress and grief,<br>my soul has often found relief,<br>and oft escaped the tempter's snare<br>by thy return, sweet hour of prayer!<br><br>2. 	Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br>the joys I feel, the bliss I share<br>of those whose anxious spirits burn<br>with strong desires for thy return!<br>With such I hasten to the place<br>where God my Savior shows his face,<br>and gladly take my station there,<br>and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!<br><br>3. 	Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!<br>thy wings shall my petition bear<br>to him whose truth and faithfulness<br>engage the waiting soul to bless.<br>And since he bids me seek his face,<br>believe his word, and trust his grace,<br>I'll cast on him my every care,<br>and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!",
