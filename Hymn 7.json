    "lyrics": "1.	I am Thine, O Lord<br>I have heard Thy voice,<br>And it told Thy love to me;<br>But I long to rise in the arms of faith<br>And be closer drawn to Thee.<br><br>Chorus: <br><br>Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord,<br>To the cross where Thou hast died.<br>Draw me nearer, nearer blessed Lord,<br>To Thy precious, bleeding side.<br><br>2.  Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,<br>	By the power of grace divine;<br>Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,<br>	And my will be lost in Thine.<br><br>3.  Oh the pure delight of a single hour<br>That before Thy throne I spend,<br>When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God<br>I commune as friend with friend!<br><br>4.  There are depths of love<br>that I cannot know<br>Till I cross the narrow sea;<br>There are heights of joy<br>that I may not reach<br>Till I rest in peace with Thee.",
