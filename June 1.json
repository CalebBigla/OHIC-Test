    "bodyText": "We will be discussing the final season of a person’s life today. At this stage, you are asking, “What legacy am I going to leave behind if God calls me home today?” At this point, you are not thinking of what happens while you are still here on earth; all that you start pursuing is a great legacy for yourself.<br>When you read 2 Timothy 4:7 and then backtrack to two chapters before that, you would see what Paul was telling Timothy in 2 Timothy 2:2:<br><b>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</b><br>He wanted to ensure that the things he stood for – his legacy, didn’t die with him. There is no way you can create a legacy if you are not already known for something while still alive. Start pursuing a godly course that you know the Lord has given you a burden for.<br>It’s a pity that only a few people ever get to this season in their lives. Many care only about what happens when they are on earth but the wise few care more about what will be said of them when they leave this world. If you are amongst these wise few, your reputation would be more important to you than all the money in the world. Proverbs 22:1 says:<br<b>A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.</b><br>When you get to this season, you wouldn’t want anything to stain your name at all; instead, you would want to be remembered for greatness. You would spend time with your family members and loved ones. There are people who pursued many things at the expense of their families only to later realise that the children they neglected were the only ones they could rely on to continue with their legacy. If you really want to have a great legacy, you must spend time pouring yourself into your children. You should live your life in such a way that when you leave this world, they will have great things to say about you.",
