    "lyrics": "1.	Onward, Christian soldiers,<br>marching as to war,<br>With the cross of Jesus going on before!<br>Christ, the royal Master,<br>leads against the foe;<br>Forward into battle, see his banner go!<br><br>Refrain:<br><br>Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,<br>With the cross of Jesus going on before!<br><br>2.	At the name of Jesus <br>Satan's host doth flee;<br>On, then, Christian soldiers,<br>on to victory!<br>Hell's foundations quiver <br>at the shout of praise;<br>Brothers, lift your voices,<br>loud your anthems raise!<br><br>3.	Like a mighty army<br>moves the church of God;<br>Brothers, we are treading<br>where the saints have trod;<br>We are not divided; all one body we,<br>One in hope and doctrine, one in charity. <br><br>4.	Crowns and thrones may perish,<br>Kingdoms rise and wane;<br>But the church Jesus <br>constant will remain:<br>Gates of hell can never<br>‘gainst that church prevail<br>We have Christ’s own promise<br>and that cannot fail<br><br>5.	Onward, then, ye people,<br>join our happy throng,<br>Blend with ours your voices,<br>in the triumph song;<br>Glory, praise and honour,<br>unto Christ the King;<br>This through countless ages,<br>men and angels sing.",
