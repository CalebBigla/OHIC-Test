    "lyrics": "1.	O what a wonderful, wonderful day<br>Day I will never forget<br>After I'd wandered in darkness away<br>Jesus my Saviour I met<br>O what a tender, compassionate friend<br>He met the need of my heart<br>Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling<br>He made all the darkness depart<br><br>Heaven came down<br>and glory filled my soul<br>When at the cross my Saviour made me whole<br>My sins were washed away<br>And my night was turned to day<br>Heaven came down and glory filled my soul<br><br>2.	Born of the Spirit with life from above<br>Into God's fam'ly divine<br>Justified fully thru Calvary's love<br>O what a standing is mine<br>And the transaction so quickly was made<br>When as a sinner I came<br>Took of the offer of grace He did proffer<br>He saved me, O praise His dear name<br><br>3.	Now I've hope that will surely endure<br>After the passing of time;<br>I have a future in Heaven for sure<br>There in those mansions sublime<br>And it's because of that wonderful day<br>When at the cross I believed;<br>Riches eternal and blessings supernal<br>From His precious hand I received.",
