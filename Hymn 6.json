    "lyrics": "1.	 I am so glad that our Father in Heaven<br>Tells of His love in the Book He has given;<br>	Wonderful things in the Bible I see,<br>This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.<br><br>Refrain<br><br>I am so glad that Jesus loves me,<br>Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me.<br>I am so glad that Jesus loves me,<br>Jesus loves even me.<br><br>2.	Jesus loves me and I know I love Him;<br>	Love brought Him down my lost soul to redeem;<br>Yes, it was love made Him die on the tree:<br>	Oh, I am certain that Jesus loves me.<br><br>3.	In this assurance I find sweetest rest,<br>Trusting in Jesus, I know I am blessed;<br>Satan, dismayed, from my soul now doth flee,<br>When I just tell him that Jesus loves me.<br><br>4.	Oh, if there’s only one song I can sing,<br>When in His beauty I see the great King,<br>This shall my song through eternity be,<br>“Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me!”<br><br>5.	If one should ask of me, how can I tell?<br>Glory to Jesus, I know very well!<br>God’s Holy Spirit with mine doth agree,<br>Constantly witnessing Jesus loves me.",
