  "lyrics": "1. Amazing grace! How sweet the sound<br>That saved a wretch like me!<br>I once was lost, 	but now am found;<br>Was blind, but now I see.<br><br>2.	Through many dangers, toils and snares,<br>I have already come;<br>’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,<br>And grace will lead me home.<br><br>3.	The Lord has promised good to me,<br>His Word my hope secures;<br>He will my Shield and Portion be,<br>As long as life endures.<br><br>4.	Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,<br>And mortal life shall cease,<br>I shall possess, within the veil,<br>A life of joy and peace.<br><br>5.	The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,<br>The sun forbear to shine;<br>But God, who called me here below,<br>Will be forever mine.<br><br>6.	When we’ve been there ten thousand years,<br>Bright shining as the sun,<br>We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise<br>Than when we’d first begun.",
