Holy words long preserved<br>For our walk in this world<br>They resound with God's own heart<br>Oh, let the ancient words impart<br><br>Chorus:<br><br>Ancient words, ever true<br>Changing me and changing you<br>We have come with open hearts<br>Oh, let the ancient words impart<br><br>2.	Words of life, words of hope<br>Give us strength, help us cope<br>In this world, where e'er we roam<br>Ancient words will guide us home<br><br>3.	Holy words of our faith<br>Handed down to this age<br>Came to us through sacrifice<br>Oh, heed the faithful words of Christ<br><br>4.	Holy words long preserved<br>For our walk in this world<br>They resound with God's own heart<br>Oh, let the ancient words impart",
