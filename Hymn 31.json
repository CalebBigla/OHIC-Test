Wonderful story of love!<br>Tell it to me again;<br>Wonderful story of love!<br>Wake the immortal strain.<br>Angels with rapture announce it,<br>Shepherds with wonder receive it;<br>Sinner, O won’t you believe it?<br>Wonderful story of love!<br><br>Refrain:<br><br>	Wonderful! Wonderful!<br>Wonderful story, <br>Wonderful story of love!<br>2. 	Wonderful story of love!<br>Though you are far away;<br>Wonderful story of love!<br>Still he doth call today.<br>Calling from Calvary’s mountain,<br>Down from the crystal bright fountain,<br>E’en from the dawn of creation;<br>Wonderful story of love!<br><br>3. 	Wonderful story of love!<br>Jesus provides a rest;<br>Wonderful story of love!<br>For all the pure and blest;<br>Rest in those mansions above us,<br>With those who’ve gone on before us,<br>Singing the rapturous chorus;<br>Wonderful story of love!",
