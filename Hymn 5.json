Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine<br>Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine<br>Heir of salvation, purchase of God<br>Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood<br><br>Chorus:<br><br>This is my story, this is my song<br>Praising my Saviour all the day long<br>This is my story, this is my song<br>Praising my Saviour all the day long<br><br>2.	Perfect submission, perfect delight,<br>Visions of rapture now burst on my sight,<br>Angel descending, bring from above<br>Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.<br><br>3.	Perfect submission, all is at rest<br>I in my Savior am happy and blessed<br>Watching and waiting, looking above<br>Filled with His goodness, lost in His love",
