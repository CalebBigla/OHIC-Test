When we walk with the Lord<br>in the light of his word,<br>what a glory he sheds on our way!<br>While we do his good will,<br>he abides with us still,<br>and with all who will trust and obey.<br><br>Refrain: <br>Trust and obey, for there's no other way<br>to be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey.<br><br>2. 	But we never can prove<br>the delights of his love<br>until all on the altar we lay;<br>for the favor he shows,<br>for the joy he bestows,<br>are for them who will trust and obey. [Refrain]<br><br>3. 	Then in fellowship sweet<br>we will sit at his feet,<br>or we'll walk by his side in the way;<br>what he says we will do,<br>where he sends we will go;<br>never fear, only trust and obey. [Refrain]",
