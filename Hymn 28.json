What can wash away my sin?<br>Nothing but the blood of Jesus.<br>What can make me whole again?<br>Nothing but the blood of Jesus.<br><br>Refrain:<br><br> 	O precious is the flow<br>that makes me white as snow;<br>no other fount I know;<br>nothing but the blood of Jesus.<br><br>2. 	For my pardon this I see:<br>nothing but the blood of Jesus.<br>For my cleansing this my plea:<br>nothing but the blood of Jesus. [Refrain]<br><br>3.	Nothing can for sin atone:<br>nothing but the blood of Jesus.<br>Naught of good that I have done:<br>nothing but the blood of Jesus. [Refrain]<br><br>4. 	This is all my hope and peace:<br>nothing but the blood of Jesus.<br>This is all my righteousness:<br>nothing but the blood of Jesus. [Refrain]",
