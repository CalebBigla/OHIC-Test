    "lyrics": "1. 	Standing on the promises of Christ, my King,<br>Through eternal ages let his praises ring;<br>Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing,<br>Standing on the promises of God.<br><br>Refrain:<br><br>	Standing, standing,<br>Standing on the promises of God, my Savior;<br>Standing, standing,<br>I'm standing on the promises of God.<br><br>2. 	Standing on the promises that cannot fail.<br>When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,<br>By the living Word of God I shall prevail,<br>Standing on the promises of God. [Refrain]<br><br>3. 	Standing on the promises of Christ, the Lord,<br>Bound to him eternally by love's strong cord,<br>Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,<br>Standing on the promises of God. [Refrain]<br><br>4. 	Standing on the promises I cannot fall,<br>List'ning ev'ry moment to the Spirit's call,<br>Resting in my Savior as my all in all,<br>Standing on the promises of God. [Refrain]",
