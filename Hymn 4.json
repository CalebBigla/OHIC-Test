    "lyrics": "1.	Be glad in the Lord and rejoice,<br>All ye that are upright in heart;<br>And ye that have made him your choice,<br>Bid sadness and sorrow depart.<br><br>Refrain:<br><br>Rejoice, rejoice!<br>Be glad in the Lord and rejoice!<br><br>2.	Be joyful, for He is the Lord,<br>On earth and in heaven supreme;<br>He fashions and rules by His word;<br>The Mighty and strong to redeem<br><br>3.	What though in the conflict for right<br>Your enemies almost prevail,<br>God’s armies, just hid from your sight,<br>Are more than the foes which assail.<br><br>4.	Though darkness surround you by day,<br>Your sky by the night be o’ercast,<br>Let nothing your spirit dismay,<br>But trust till the danger is past.<br><br>5.	Be glad in the Lord and rejoice,<br>His praises proclaiming in song;<br>With harp, and with organ and voice<br>	The loud hallelujahs prolong!",
