    "lyrics": "1.	I’ve found a friend in Jesus,<br>He’s everything to me,<br>He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my 	soul; <br>The Lily of the valley, in Him alone I see<br>All I need to cleanse and make me fully	whole.<br>In sorrow He’s my comfort, in trouble He’s my stay, <br>He tells me every care on Him to roll: (Halleluyah)<br><br>Chorus:<br><br>He’s the Lily of the Valley,<br>the Bright and Morning Star,<br>He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.<br><br>2.	He all my griefs has taken,<br>and all my sorrows borne;<br>In temptation He’s my strong and mighty tower;<br>I’ve all for Him forsaken,<br>and all	my idols torn <br>From my heart, and now He keeps me by His power.<br>Though all the world forsake me, and Satan tempt me sore,<br> Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal: (Halleluyah)<br><br>3.	He’ll never, never leave me, <br>nor yet forsake me here, <br>While I live by faith and do His blessed will;<br>A wall of fire about me, I’ve nothing now to fear, <br>With His manna He my hungry soul shall 	fill.<br>Then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face,<br>Where rivers of delight shall ever roll:(Halleluyah)",
