    "lyrics": "1.	When peace like a river attendeth my way,<br>when sorrows like sea billows roll;<br>whatever my lot, thou hast taught me to say,<br>It is well, it is well with my soul.<br><br>Refrain<br><br> (may be sung after final stanza only):<br>It is well with my soul;<br>it is well, it is well with my soul.<br><br>2.	Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,<br>let this blest assurance control:<br>that Christ has regarded my helpless estate,<br>and has shed his own blood for my soul. Refrain<br><br>3. 	My sin oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!<br>my sin, not in part, but the whole,<br>is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more;<br>praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul! Refrain<br><br>4.	O Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,<br>the clouds be rolled back as a scroll;<br>the trump shall resound and the Lord shall descend;<br>even so, it is well with my soul. Refrain",
