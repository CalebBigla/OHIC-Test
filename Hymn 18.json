    "lyrics": "1. 	Praise to the Lord, <br>the Almighty, the King of creation!<br>O my soul, praise Him, for he is thy health and salvation:<br>Join the great throng<br>psaltery, organ and song<br>sounding in glad adoration.<br><br>2. 	Praise to the Lord, <br>over all things he gloriously reigneth:<br>Borne as on eagle-wings, safely his saints, He sustaineth<br>Has thou not seen<br>How all thou needest hath been<br>Granted in what he ordaineth?<br><br>3. 	Praise to the Lord, <br>Who doth prosper thy way and defend thee;<br>Surely his goodness and mercy shall ever attend thee;<br> ponder anew, What the almighty can do<br>Who with his love doth befriend thee.<br><br>4. 	Praise to the Lord! <br>O let all that is in me adore him!<br>All that has breath join with Abraham's Seed to adore him!<br>Let the Amen, sum all our praises again;<br>Now as we worship before him.",
